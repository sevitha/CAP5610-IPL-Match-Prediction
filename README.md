The project aimed to develop a system for predicting the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches and the scores of individual innings. The objectives were to collect and preprocess historical IPL match data, perform feature engineering to identify relevant features, and train various machine learning models for match prediction and score prediction. The project involved implementing techniques such as data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The deliverables included a match prediction dataset and a score prediction dataset, as well as the implemented system capable of accurately predicting the winning team and the runs scored by the winning team in IPL matches.
